# Rover
EnTech Interview Exercise
Full Stack Coding Exercise
In the language of your choice write a sample app that does the following:
You are writing some logic for a rover that will land on Mars and will need to be remotely navigated. The terrain will be mapped to a 5x5 square totaling 25 cells to which the rover will need the ability to navigate to.
The rover will start in the center square which will be referenced as position (0,0) or (X,Y). When moving up one vertical positional square from (0,0) the new position would be (0,1). Moving right one position would put the rover at (1,0), moving one square to the left from center would place it at (-1,0) and one space down from center would put the new position at (0,-1).
Write some logic that will allow the rover to be navigated from the starting position of (0,0) to each of the following coordinates and output the current position to the user via UI or a command line output.
The stops on the board should be:
(1, 1)
(-2, -2)
(2, 2)
(-1, -1)
(2,- 2)
For dev ops candidates, please explain how you would configure this POC application so that a team could collaborate and iterate this forward. Testing/code quality metrics, branching strategy, CI/CD pipeline, Kubernetes, Azure and hosting strategies should all be touched upon.
Please complete and come to the interview with as much progress as possible and be prepared to share your screen to walk through your code and explain your thinking on why you wrote and structured your code the way you did. It is perfectly understandable if you don’t complete this entire task in the 24 hours that you’ve been given, so please don’t stress the completion, this is more of an exercise to see how you problem solve and write code.
